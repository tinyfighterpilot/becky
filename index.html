      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="imgs/IMG_4401-EDIT.jpg">
      <p>During my childhood, I always harbored dreams of possessing an enormous wardrobe brimming with clothes and every conceivable accessory. Consequently, I indulged in this desire for some time. However, what I eventually learned was that consumerism is an insatiable thirst. This realization became abundantly clear when I became a first time mom.</p>

      <h1>The Motivation</h1>
      <p>The burden of managing all the clutter and the associated cleaning and maintenance became overwhelming. It was during my darkest moments that I stumbled upon minimalism, and it genuinely rescued me. In the ensuing years, I've discovered the art of contentment and living with a more deliberate purpose. I'm passionate about sharing my minimalist journey because I've personally experienced how embracing a simpler life can profoundly transform one's existence.      </p>
